# ecg-module-pulse-sensor313
The ECG signal module, pulse sensor, and oximeter integration project focuses on designing a sophisticated healthcare solution capable of monitoring and assessing key physiological parameters. This includes monitoring the heart's electrical activity (ECG), tracking pulse rate and blood oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) using a pulse sensor.
